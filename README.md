# Image-Forgery-Localization-using-UNet-Architecture
Images can convey a wealth of information and often have a greater impact than plain text.
But due to the Easy access to digital tools like Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, and AI algorithms, The increase in image manipulation and tampering poses a significant challenge.
This Re-shapes public opinion, influence elections, ignite violence, harm the reputation of individuals and organizations among many other issues.

The Objective is to build a model which can detect the authenticity of an image and localize the tampered portion of the image. To address this issue, UNet architecture is utilized.

Dataset - **IEEE IFS-TC Image Forensics Challenge data**
(It has both authenticated and manipulated images. For every manipulated image we have its corresponding mask that contain only white and black color pixels)

You can download the Dataset from the below link.
